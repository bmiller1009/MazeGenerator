This is a simple command-line maze generator I wrote just to gain a better understanding of maze algorithms.

Usage
See Main.cs in the Driver folder.  Simply instantiate a maze object, and pass in the length and width of the maze.
The rest of the code in Main() is simply emitting the maze matrix to standard out.
